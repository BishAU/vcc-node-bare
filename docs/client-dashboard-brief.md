# VCC Client Dashboard Implementation Brief

## Implementation Progress Report (Updated)

### ‚úÖ Completed Features

1. Technology Stack
- Front-End: React 18 with TypeScript
- Build Tool: Vite
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- State Management: Zustand
- Testing: Vitest with React Testing Library

2. Core Integrations
- Stripe SDK integration (src/lib/stripe.ts)
  - Payment intent creation
  - Subscription management
  - Webhook structure
- Xero SDK integration (src/lib/xero.ts)
  - Invoice creation
  - Payment synchronization
  - Invoice status tracking
- Authentication system
  - NextAuth.js implementation
  - Protected routes
  - User management

3. Frontend Components
- Responsive layout with Navbar and Footer
- Protected route wrappers
- Admin route protection
- Basic dashboard structure

### üöß In Progress/Missing Features

1. Database Schema (Priority: High)
- Need to create Prisma schema for:
  - Users
  - Products
  - Orders
  - Subscriptions
  - Invoices
  - GL Codes

2. API Implementation (Priority: High)
- Missing endpoints:
  - /api/create-payment-intent
  - /api/xero/create-invoice
  - Product management endpoints
  - Subscription management endpoints
  - User management endpoints

3. Environment Configuration (Priority: Medium)
- Need comprehensive .env setup
- Documentation for required variables
- Development/production environment separation

4. Testing (Priority: Medium)
- Unit tests for API endpoints
- Integration tests for Stripe/Xero
- E2E testing for critical flows

5. Admin Panel (Priority: High)
- Product management interface
- Order tracking system
- Subscription management
- GL code management
- Analytics dashboard

6. Documentation (Priority: Medium)
- API documentation
- Setup instructions
- Deployment guide
- Testing guide

### üîÑ Next Steps

1. Immediate Actions (Sprint 1):
   - Create Prisma schema
   - Implement missing API endpoints
   - Set up environment configuration

2. Following Sprint:
   - Build admin panel interface
   - Implement testing suite
   - Create documentation

3. Final Sprint:
   - Deploy to staging
   - User acceptance testing
   - Production deployment

### üîç Notes
- Current branch: dashboard-dev-schema
- All integrations (Stripe, Xero) are initialized but need endpoint implementation
- Frontend components are ready for data integration

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Risks
1. Data synchronization between Stripe and Xero
2. Handling failed payments and retry logic
3. Subscription state management complexity
4. GL code mapping accuracy
